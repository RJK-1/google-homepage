The google-homepage challenge was fun and engaging, and allowed me to put alot of knowledge (and google itself!) to good use. I have got my head around parent/child elements and containers and moving them. 

I enjoyed using trial and error to match the actual google homepage positions, colours, and hover effects, as well as locations of links (which actually link to the relevant pages)

I had trouble initially pushing this all to git, but know now I was using "master" not "main" - it nearly lost me the whole code, luckily I still had the live server up and was able to copy it from there.
